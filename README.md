# OpenStreetWms
This project is meant to add a WMS layer as an overlay to the Open Street Map.
This may be just a demonstration for how to use a WMS server url to add the Map Tiles over the map.
A map has been initiated with automatic zoom to India's bounding box.
SHOW WMS button for adding a WMS layer on the India Map which automatically calculates the bounding box and downloads the WMS Map Tiles from the server URL provided, and overlays the WMS Tiles on the map.
SHOW MAPNIK button for restoring the original map as it is before.

Important instruction:
Please do not distrubute this code as it is not meant for commercial use.
Beginner programmers can use it for getting common ideas on how we can add the WMS layer over the latest version of OSMDroid as the earlier version codes are all deprecated.
